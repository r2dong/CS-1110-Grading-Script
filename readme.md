Python Unit Testing
===================

### Project Overview
Correctness of functions are determined by comparing return value with either a correct implementation of the same function or a set of fixed inputs and return values. This program works only for pure functions, ie, functions that have fixed output given fixed input. For example, functions that generate random numbers could not be properly tested.

If a correct implementation is available, inputs of a function are specified as a list of types and their according restrictions, such as minimum and maximum value of intergers. The program then generates random values as inputs to functions based on the type and restrictions.

All inputs and outputs will be appended to the end of file containing functions to be tested as comments. Additional code may be provided for customized output.

Python Unit Testing
===================

### Overview
Correctness of functions are determined by comparing return value with either a correct implementation or a set of hard-coded inputs and return values. This program works only for pure functions (those return fixed values given fixed input). Test results are appended to source files being tested, and additional instructions may be provided for more customized output.

If a correct implementation is available, details on all inputs of a function are specified, and the program generates according random values as inputs to functions.

A GUI is being developed currently, and a more detailed description will be provided once everything is integrated and packaged.
